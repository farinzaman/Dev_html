    <h1> Hyper Links</h1>
    <p>A hyperlink is a clickable element in a webpage that directs users to another location, either within the same
        website or on a different website. It can be in the form of text, images, or buttons. Hyperlinks are created
        using the HTML <a> (anchor) tag, with the href attribute specifying the destination URL. They are essential for
            web navigation, allowing users to move seamlessly between pages and access related content, making the
            internet interconnected and easy to explore.</p>
    <p>Hyperlinks not only connect different webpages but also enhance the user experience by making information easily
        accessible. They can link to documents, images, videos, email addresses, or even specific sections within the
        same page, called anchor links. Hyperlinks can be text-based, where a word or phrase is clickable, or
        image-based, where clicking on an image takes the user to another location. They are essential for search engine
        optimization (SEO), as search engines use links to discover and rank pages. Additionally, hyperlinks can be
        styled with CSS to change colors, underline text, or add hover effects, making websites more visually appealing
        and interactive. Modern web design often uses hyperlinks creatively, such as buttons, menus, and navigation
        bars, to guide users efficiently through a website</p>
    <p>Hyper links are very important in Html codes.Here is an example for Hyper Link</p>

    <a href="https://www.google.com">here is google</a>

    <p><b>Let's see now how Anchor Linking works.</b></p>
    <h2 id="cats">Cats are cute .</h2>
    <p>Cats are often considered cute because of their physical features, behaviors, and sounds. They have large eyes,
        small noses, soft fur, and round faces, which make them look “baby-like” and trigger human nurturing instincts.
        Their small size, graceful movements, and playful antics make them visually appealing, while purring, meowing,
        and subtle facial expressions evoke affection. Additionally, their curious and sometimes clumsy behavior adds
        personality that humans find endearing. All these traits combine to make cats irresistibly charming to many
        people.Their unpredictable yet charming behavior, combined with their soft appearance and soothing sounds, makes
        them beloved pets and companions around the world. Cats also have an instinct for finding cozy spots, like
        sunlit corners or snug blankets, which adds to their appeal. Their playful curiosity encourages interaction and
        entertainment, making them both amusing and comforting to watch. Many people also find joy in their independent
        nature, as cats can be affectionate without being demanding, striking a perfect balance that appeals to human
        emotions. All of these qualities together create a sense of joy and attachment that explains why cats are widely
        considered cute and lovable.</p>
